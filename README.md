| [Exploratory Data Analysis - Telecom](https://github.com/dpyshnenko/Data-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Telecom) | In this project, I evaluated the customer profile on two prepaid plans for the telecommunication company. Initially, I completed data preprocessing incl. missing values, duplicates and data types. Next during exploratory data analysis, I performed scans of customer profile, created graphs and provided description and observations about clients' behaviour.  Based on the output I generated and tested multiple hypotheses (revenue and customer location impact). Finally, I provided overall recommendations for the advertising budget for both plans. | *numpy*, *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *scipy* |
