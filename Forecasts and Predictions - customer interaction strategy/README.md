# Forecasts and Predictions for the gym chain

# Project goals:
- Analyze data about customers of the fitness centers;
- Predict the probability of churn (at the next month's level) for each customer;
- Identify target groups and highlight distinctive properties of each group;
- Analyze the main features that have the biggest impact on;
- Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service.

# Data

  * 'Month_to_end_contract' — the months remaining until the contract expires
  * 'Group_visits' — whether the user takes part in group sessions
  * 'Avg_class_frequency_total' — average frequency of visits per week over the customer's lifetime
  * 'Avg_class_frequency_current_month' — average frequency of visits per week over the preceding month
  * 'Avg_additional_charges_total' — the total amount of money spent on other gym services: cafe, athletic goods, cosmetics, massages, etc.
